I'm a research scientist at the [Digital Humanities Laboratory of the EPFL](https://dhlab.epfl.ch), where I work in the [*Impresso* project](https://impresso-project.ch/) on methods for text mining and information extraction from a large collection of digitized newspapers. I obtained my PhD at the [Digital Humanities department at Kingâ€™s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/index.aspx), under the supervision of Prof. Willard McCarty, with a thesis on methods for citation mining of classics Publications. I recently published with Gabriel Bodard an open access volume entitled [*Digital Classics Outside the Echo-Chamber*](http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bat) (Ubiquity Press, 2016).

I'm a Digital Humanities specialist with expertise in the areas of classics, archaeology and history. My main research interests include natural language processing and information extraction, especially their domain-specific applications; citation mining and analysis; and applications of semantic web technologies in the humanities.

Before joining the EPFL I worked as a teaching fellow at the University of Rostock, as a researcher at the German Archaeological Institute, and was visiting research scholar at Tufts University (Perseus project).
