Digital scholarly publications as APIs: the case of the Structures of Epic Poetry compendium	Talk	dcsb	Digital Classicist Seminar Berlin	2020-02-18	Berlin, Germany		"**Slides:** [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3773330.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3773330)

## Abstract

Indices (e.g. *locorum*, *nominum*, *rerum*) facilitate the readers' orientation within a
printed publication and help them find the information they are looking for. While the transition to digitalpublishing does not render indices less useful, it does require us to find an adequate adaptation of such indices for a digital publishing environment. What should an index of a digital scholarly publication look like? As argued by McGuire (2013), the natural translation of a printed index in a digital environment is an API (Application Programming Interface) — i.e. a machine-friendly interface aimed at enabling the programmatic access to content published on the Web — and the job of “good publishers of the future” is to provide APIs for their publications.  

To demostrate the potential of conceiving scholarly publications as APIs we discuss the case of the [*Structures of Epic Poetry* compendium](https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/475925), a publication edited by Simone Finkmann and Christiane Reitz, and to be published by DeGruyter. The compendium consists of three volumes, with the second volume being further divided into two tomes, and a total of 72 chapters and 60 contributing authors. The sheer number of references to primary sources contained in the compendium (ca. 10,000 references in total) raised considerable challenges for the creation of the *index locorum*. To tackle this problem, a semi-automatic workflow was devised; the [*CitedLoci* pipeline](http://citedloci.org/) was used to for the automatic indexing of such references, while student assistants verified and corrected the results it produced. This process allowed us to create a database of cited passages that served multiple purposes. Firstly, it was used to generate the *indices locorum*, one for each volume, to be included in the printed publication. Secondly, it enabled us to create the EpiBau digital companion, a Web application and API that makes the compendium’s contents more readily and easily searchable by its readers, and publishes part of the raw data on which the individual chapters are based. [2] In particular, the API provides access to the companion's contents by categories epic structures, extracted keywords and cited passages.

We believe that providing digital scholarly publications with appropriate APIs has the potential radically to change the future consumption, discovery and retrieval of publication contents. Such APIs can exist either at the level of single publication – such is the case with this compendium – or can be developed for entire portals, publication series, or even publishers offers. Thanks to these APIs, the accessibility and discoverability of relevant publications can be enhanced by implementing services that provide researchers with publication alerts based on the quotation of specific sources or with links to publications on a specific passage.

Les citations canoniques sont la manière standard de citer les sources primaires et sont présentes dans les publications scientifiques en études classiques. Leur importance réside dans le fait qu'elles signalent des passages ou extraits de textes -- souvent en relation les uns avec les autres -- qui ont été étudiés et discutés par des chercheurs. Bien que les lettres classiques aient longtemps exploité ce genre de citations en créant manuellement des index des passages cités, elles sont maintenant confrontées à un nouveau défi : comment extraire et exploiter la grande quantité de citations dans des archives de publications à grande échelle ?

Dans cette présentation, Matteo Romanello présentera les technologies d'extraction des références bibliographiques développées dans le projet Cited Loci pour l'extraction des citations canoniques. Il évoquera ensuite trois exemples d'application de ces technologies dans différents domaines :
1. aider la compilation d'un index locorum dans un projet éditorial
2. améliorer la capacité de trouver des publications pertinentes dans l'archive JSTOR
3. étudier des aspects de la réception des auteurs classiques dans la littérature savante en utilisant les citations comment un proxy de leur succès

*English presentation*

Canonical citations are the standard way of citing primary sources and are found throughout publications in Classics. Their importance lies in that they signal text passages that were studied and discussed by scholars, often in relation to one another. While classicists have long been exploiting this kind citations by creating manually indexes of cited passages, they are now faced with a new challenge: how can the sheer amount of citations be captured from large-scale publication archives? In this talk I first present the citation mining technologies developed in the context of the Cited Loci project for the extraction of canonical references. I then discuss three applications of these technologies in different areas:

1. to support the creation of an index locorum within a publication project
2. to improve the retrieval of relevant publications from the JSTOR archive
3. to study aspects of the scholarly reception of classical authors by using citations as a proxy of their success"
Introducing the CLEF 2020 HIPE Shared Task: Named Entity Recognition and Linking on Historical Newspapers	Talk	hipe-ecir		2020-04-16	Lisbon, Portugal + zoom		"**Slides:** [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3754236.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3754236)

## Abstract 

Since its introduction some twenty years ago, named entity (NE) processing has become an essential component of virtually any text mining application and has undergone major changes. Recently, two main trends characterise its developments: the adoption of deep learning architectures and the consideration of textual material originating from historical and cultural heritage collections. While the former opens up new opportunities, the latter introduces new challenges with heterogeneous, historical and noisy inputs. If NE processing tools are increasingly being used in the context of historical documents, performance values are below the ones on contemporary data and are hardly comparable. In this context, this paper introduces the CLEF 2020 Evaluation Lab HIPE (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities) on named entity recognition and linking on diachronic historical newspaper material in French, German and English. Our objective is threefold: strengthening the robustness of existing approaches on non-standard inputs, enabling performance comparison of NE processing on historical texts, and, in the long run, fostering efficient semantic indexing of historical documents in order to support scholarship on digital cultural heritage collections."
