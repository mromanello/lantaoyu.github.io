2016-01-01	Exploring Intertextuality in Classics through Citation Networks	Digital Humanities Quarterly 10(2)	Referring constitutes such an essential scholarly activity across disciplines that it has been regarded by Unsworth (2000) as one of the scholarly primitives. In Classics, in particular, the references to passages of the ancient texts — the so-called canonical citations (or references) — play a prominent role. The potential of these citations, however, has not been fully exploited to date, despite the attention that they have recently received in the field of Digital Humanities. In this paper I discuss two aspects of making such citations computable. Firstly, I illustrate how they can be extracted from text by using Natural Language Processing techniques, especially Named Entity Recognition. Secondly, I discuss the creation of a three-level citation network to formalise the web of relations between texts that canonical references implicitly constitute. As I outline in the conclusive section of this paper, the possible uses of the extracted citation network include the development of search applications and recommender systems for bibliography; the enhancement of digital environments to read primary sources with links to related secondary literature; and the application of these network to the study of intertextuality and text reception.

2014-01-01	Mining Citations, Linking Texts	ISAW Papers 7	Canonical citations are the standard way of citing primary sources (i.e., the ancient texts) in Classics: the ability to read them, which requires knowing what numerous abbreviations stand for, is part of the early training of any classicist. Having an expert system to capture automatically these citations and their meaning is one of the aims of the project of which the research presented in this paper is part. The desire for such a system has existed for a considerable amount of time (Crane, Seales, and Terras 2009, 26) but has yet to be solved (Romanello, Boschetti, and Crane 2009; Romanello 2013). Such a system has great potential both for scholars in Classics and for the study of Classics as a discipline: capturing the citations of ancient texts that are contained in journal articles, commentaries, monographs and other secondary sources, allows us, for example, to track over time how and how often texts were studied, essential pieces of information for a data-driven study of the discipline and its evolution. Another possible use of the system is to display related bibliographic references within a reading environment for ancient texts. The examples that are used in this paper are taken from work that has been done to provide the GapVis interface of the Hellespont project1 with such a functionality (see Fig. 1). One of the goals of the project is to create an enhanced virtual reading environment for one specific section of Thucydides’ Histories, the so-called “Pentecontaetia” (Thuc. 1,89 to 1,118). The references that are displayed in the secondary literature view of the reading interface are mined automatically from JSTOR and are shown together with links to the full text of the journal article as well as to the cited passage in the Perseus digital library (Romanello and Thomas 2012).

2019-06-30	Citation Mining of Humanities Journals: The Progress to Date and the Challenges Ahead	Journal of European Periodical Studies 4(1)	Even large citation indexes such as the Web of Science, Scopus or Google Scholar cover only a small fraction of the literature in the humanities. This coverage sensibly decreases going backwards in time. Citation mining of humanities publications — defined as an instance of bibliometric data mining and as a means to the end of building comprehensive citation indexes — remains an open problem. In this contribution we discuss the results of two recent projects in this area: Cited Loci and Linked Books. The former focused on the domain of classics, using journal articles in JSTOR as a corpus; the latter considered the historiography on Venice and a novel corpus of journals and monographs. Both projects attempted to mine citations of all kinds — abbreviated and not, to all types of sources, including primary sources — and considered a wide time span (19th to 21st century). We first discuss the current state of research in citation mining of humanities publications. We then present the various steps involved into this process, from corpus selection to data publication, discussing the peculiarities of the humanities. The approaches taken by the two projects are compared, allowing us to highlight disciplinary differences and commonalities, as well as shared challenges between historiography and classics on this respect. The resulting picture portrays humanities citation mining as a field with a great, yet mostly untapped potential, and a few still open challenges. The potential lies in using citations as a means to interconnect digitized collections at a large scale, by making explicit the linking function of bibliographic citations. As for the open challenges, a key issue is the existing need for an integrated metadata infrastructure and an appropriate legal framework to facilitate citation mining in the humanities.

2019-06-01	Linked Books: un indice citazionale per la storia di Venezia	DigItalia vol. 1 (2019)	Presentiamo i risultati del progetto Linked Books, che ha portato alla creazione di un prototipo per un indice citazionale capace di collegare il catalogo bibliotecario nazionale italiano (Opac SBN) con il sistema informativo dell’Archivio di Stato di Venezia e con i portali d’autorità e “metamotori” di ricerca internazionali (VIAF.org, Europeana). Il prototipo include 3.850.581 citazioni estratte da un corpus di 2.475 volumi, di cui 1.905 monografie e 552 numeri di rivista, da cui 5.496 articoli, riguardanti la storia di Venezia. Il progetto Linked Books ha permesso di esplorare la fattibilità e l’opportunità della creazione di un indice citazionale per discipline umanistiche, e di affrontare e risolvere ostacoli tecnici quali la creazione di un corpus rappresentativo a partire da risorse e competenze bibliografiche, la digitalizzazione dei materiali nel rispetto dei diritti d’autore, l’estrazione automatica di citazionie lo sviluppo di interfacce di ricerca per il pubblico.
